# My Awesome Work Calendar

## Description

This website was built to be able to schedule day to day work activities. It utilizes updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It also utilizes Day.js in the browser to keep track of time. During this project I learned about the "this" keyword, expanded on jQuery skills, and also continued working with my Javascript knowledge.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon loading, you will see the day, date, and time at the top of the page. After that you will see time blocks for a 9 AM to 5 PM day. If you click on a time block, you can save an activity for that hour block into localStorage. Past hours are in grey, the current hour is in red, and future hours are in green. If you reload the page, the items saved will persist.
